# kor-text-preprocess
Korean text data preprocess toolkit for NLP

## Overview
This repository contains codes for korean text preprocessing. There are several options you can use for now. Other functions will be added sooner or later.

### Options
* `clean_kor` is for cleaning korean text data like 'sejong corpus'. It will trim the unnecessary character and symbols.

* `mecab` is for morphological analysis. It provides `morphs`, `nouns`, `pos` functions for your korean text data and of course, each are selectable by additional option.
Check [KoNLPy](http://konlpy.org/en/latest/) out in detail.

* `NLP` for text data templating for certain task. For now, `next_sentence_prediction` template is only available. It arranges two sentences in a line with seperator [SEP]. Please read the description in `src/tasks.py`. Other task templates will be added in the list.
